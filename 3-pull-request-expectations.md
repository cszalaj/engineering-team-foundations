# Pull Requests #
Pull requests play a crucial role in resolving the challenges of collaborative development by addressing issues such as coordinating code changes, mitigating conflicts, fostering engineering up-skilling, and enhancing code quality. As multiple developers work concurrently on a shared project, pull requests enable a systematic approach to propose and review modifications, facilitating knowledge transfer and skill development among team members. Additionally, the review process ensures higher code quality, reducing the likelihood of bugs, enhancing overall project stability, and contributing to a more efficient and collaborative development environment.

The following guidelines provide a foundation for how pull requests should be handled across the Engineering team.

This proposal was created by Chris Szalaj, with input from Engineering Leadership and a panel of engineers including Jon Cook, Rick Dailey, Yuri Uchida, Micah Parlato, and Josh TerAvest. 

## Proposal details ##
All teams are required to have a documented pull request process. At a minimum, the documented process should include:

* guidelines around pull request size and complexity, and how the contents of a pull request should be introduced and described. 
* the number of required approvers on a pull request.
* links to any coding standards, security, testing and style guides to which contributors should adhere.
* guidance around when a conversation in feedback and comments should be transitioned to a phone call for resolution. 
* service level agreement for pull request feedback or approval turn-around time. 
* guidance regarding when other teams should be tagged or included on pull requests, such  as when a breaking change is introduced into a service, or a new coding pattern is introduced. 
* guidance on situations where a pull request is required, but approval of the pull request is not. 
* a link to the CodeOwners extension file that display configured pull request groups for repositories that are "owned" by a team. 

Each team's process need not be the same, but every team needs a documented pull request process that includes the above points.
