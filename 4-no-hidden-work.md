# No Hidden Work #
In agile teams, the principle of transparency is paramount, necessitating the visibility of all work to foster effective collaboration and communication. This transparency aligns individual and team efforts with overarching project goals, promoting adaptability to change. 

With clear visibility, teams can easily identify bottlenecks, allowing for proactive issue resolution and maintenance of a smooth workflow. The accountability established through transparency encourages a sense of ownership among team members. Additionally, this visibility supports a culture of continuous improvement, enabling teams to reflect on processes and make informed decisions for enhanced efficiency. 

Predictability in project timelines and deliveries is improved, and team members are empowered with the information needed to contribute meaningfully, creating a motivated and informed workforce. Overall, the emphasis on transparency in agile methodologies ensures a cohesive, adaptable, and empowered team capable of delivering high-quality results in dynamic environments.

An important part of making work visible is ensuring the status of your work is up-to-date. This then aids with reporting on our work, which in turn helps inform timelines and improve predictability of our work. 

The following guidelines describe how work should be made visible to your day-to-day team.

This proposal was created by Chris Szalaj, with input from Engineering Leadership and a panel of engineers including Jon Cook, Rick Dailey, Yuri Uchida, Micah Parlato, and Josh TerAvest. 

## Proposal details ##

* All work being executed by a team or team member should have a card in Jira associated with it that shows up on the team's board, and is assigned to the team member doing the work. This includes, but is not limited to:
    * work being done as part of your team objectives
    * personal work such as presentations for TLCC
    * work to update infrastructure and dependencies
    * work to improve our deployment or software engineering processes
* Teams should have a live check-in a minimum of once per week. 
* Teams should have a daily process for team members to share what they are working on each day with their team. This process can be defined by each team, and can be live or use an asynchronous process like Slack or Jira card updates, at each team's discretion. A daily process drives strong team communication and accountability.
* The Jira status of a card is expected to be kept up to date by team members responsible for the work.
* As needed, work should be made known to the broader Engineering team. Examples of things that need intentional communication outside of a team include new service launches, significant changes in architecture, application of a new design or coding pattern, or the introduction of a new library or AWS service that could have broader use across the platform. Mechanisms that can be helpful for communicating these things are [pull requests](https://tessitura.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SD/pages/3007742182/Pull+Requests "Pull request foundations"), [repository documentation](https://bitbucket.org/tessitura/tn-cloud-service-standards/src/development/ "Repository documentation standards") and [Code Zone presentations](https://tessitura.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SD/pages/2328560224/How+to+add+topics+for+Code+Zone "How to add a Code Zone Topic").
* When changes are made to the requirement or success scenarios of a card in progress, update the body or main success scenario of the card with the changes right away so that the changes are known and documented.
