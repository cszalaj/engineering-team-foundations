# Engineering Communication Expections #
As the Engineering team has grown, clear expectations around communication have not been documented for the team. Having clearly defined expectations enables team members to confidently interact with others on their team. This group of proposed communication standards clarifies what the expectations are for clear communication across the Engineering team in a remote work environment.

This standard was compiled by Chris Szalaj in collaboration with Engineering team leadership and team members over the course of 2023. 

## Details
Good communication is a fundamental element of building and maintaining trust. Trust is crucial for all teams, but especially important in a remote work environment. As part of the Engineering team, you are expected to adhere to the following communication standards. 

At Tessitura, we have chosen to implement a remote work environment that allows for great flexibility of time management. With great flexibility comes the responsibility to have great communication.

### Availability Communication Standards
Transparency around when you are at your desk, available to chat, or out of the office is important in a remote work environment. Because we don't have visual cues indicating if someone is at their desk and available to collaborate or ask questions, clearly communicating your status throughout the day is important. This ensures that your time is protected when you need to be head down and others' time is respected when you are away or out of the office.

Good communication is defined by the following:

* If you are stepping away from your desk during the day for more than 15 minutes, update Slack to say you are away. This helps people know when you are available to answer questions or collaborate.
* If you are heads down and not available to reply in Slack, update your status to indicate that. This helps protect your time and avoid interruptions.  
* When you are out of the office for any reason, planned or unplanned due to illness or emergency, do the following things. 
    * Notify your manager either via email or slack - this is the minimum requirement. 
    * Update your Outlook calendar indicating you are out of office, and add the **Innovation-Eng Prod OOO** room to the location of your out-of-office calendar appointment.
    * Cancel or decline all meetings that you have scheduled while you are out. This respects the time of people with which you've scheduled meetings.
    * Change your slack status to "away"
    * Set your Automatic Reply to indicate that you are away. 

It may not always be a reasonable expectation that all of these items can be done, particularly if you are extremely unwell or have an emergency situation. In those cases, make your best effort and do what you can to communicate your circumstances.

* If your absence was planned, complete a PTO request prior to your planned absence. If your absence was unplanned, be sure to complete a PTO request after you return to work. 
* If you are leaving early for the day, that should be communicated to your team and manager. Update your Slack status as needed to let people know you are away until the following day. 
* If you or a dependent are having health issues that prevent normal work schedule, you must communicate this to either HR or your manager so that the time can be best accommodated. 

### Work-Related Communication Standards
* If you are stuck on a card, reach out for help if you don't know what your next steps are within 1-2 hours of being stuck using the resources you have available to you. You can post to any of the Engineering Slack channels, reach out to available team members directly, or bring your question to your standup to request help.
* Help your peers. If you see someone ask for help, we are a team that enthusiastically responds to requests for help.
* We are a product development team that includes the Product group. When you make decisions or encounter deviations from requirements or main success scenarios, you are expected to reach out to Product and discuss the deviation. 
* Engineering team members are expected to ask questions when more detail is needed to understand a card's intent and requirements. 
* If there are deviations from a card as described during development, make sure cards are updated with the details of the change so that we have record of the change.
* Your first responsibility is the work you've committed to with your team. If you have work that comes in outside of what is currently prioritized on your team's board, communicate that to your manager and/or product owner for prioritization. 
* All work requires a card that is visible in the backlog for your team. There should be no "hidden work". Make cards for things like TLCC presentations that will require extended prep time and planning. This clearly communicates to the team what work you have on your plate alongside product work. 

## Risks ##
Potential impact to morale if these standards are seen as overly formal or harsh. How they are presented to the team matters.

## Measurement ##
We should see communication improve across the team, and have a common language for commnicating things like out of office time.
