# We Build Cloud Optimized Software #
The AWS Well Architected framework provides guidelines that define what cloud-optimized software means to us at Tessitura. As we build, use these guidelines to make decisions about our technology. 

As our team optimizes the Tessitura platform to run in the AWS cloud, we need to have a shared understanding of what building cloud-optimized software means. A shared understanding enables us to commit to a cloud-first design strategy and drive toward it with the work we do. 

Take time to read the about [Well Architected framework and its six pillars](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected). Once you've completed that, read about the associated [lenses](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/?wa-lens-whitepapers&wa-lens-whitepapers.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&wa-lens-whitepapers.sort-order=desc&wa-guidance-whitepapers.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&wa-guidance-whitepapers.sort-order=desc). 

There are [several labs](https://www.wellarchitectedlabs.com/) that help put what you read to practice, provided by AWS.
